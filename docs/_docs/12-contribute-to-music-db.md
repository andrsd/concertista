It is possible to add music to the DB that Concertista is using.

Now, you can start adding new music.

* Go to ***Station***, ***Developer...***
* You can search ***By Album*** or ***By Composer***
* Find the piece you are looking for
* Select the check mark(s) in front of the piece
* Press ***Cmd + S*** to save into a file
* Give the music work a name
  It will be pre-filled, but you should edit the name, because that how it will show to Concertista users.
* Give the file some descriptive name and save it.
